First step
==========

You've successfully :doc:`installed <installation>` Openwind, now let's get it started !

Basic Tutorial
--------------

Follow the :doc:`Basic Tutorial <basic_tutorial>` to get acquainted with Openwind and run simulations.

How to
------

Follow the :doc:`HOW TO <examples>` to be guided in the different features of Openwind.

Examples
--------

*Note:* If you installed ``openwind`` with ``pip`` or ``conda`` , you can download the ``examples/`` `following this link <https://gitlab.inria.fr/openwind/openwind/-/archive/master/openwind-master.zip?path=examples>`_

In folder ``examples/`` you will find several examples of scripts that use the toolbox
to


* compute and display the impedance of a trumpet, and of an oboe with thoneholes.
* compute and display the sound of instruments with different embouchures
* perform inversions and reconstructions of instruments with side holes
* and more...

Different folders contain examples related to the different modules of Openwind
 (technical, frequential, temporal, inversion).

Folder ``examples/Tournemenne-Chabassier_ACTA2019`` contains scripts used in
`this paper <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01963674>`_.

Folder ``examples/Ernoult-Chabassier-Rodriguez_Humeau_2021`` contains scripts used in
`a submitted paper to Acta Acustica in 2021 <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03231946>`_

Folder ``examples/Thibault-Chabassier_JASA2020`` contains scripts used in
a submitted paper to JASA in 2020.
